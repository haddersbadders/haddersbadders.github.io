teaser: Why being able to work with HTML, CSS and Javascript is as important as writing Teeline.
---
After a week or so of working with postgrad journalism students on long-form multimedia storytelling, I keep thinking more and more about how important it is for students to have a good grounding in web literacy. By web literacy I mean being able to use and manipulate web (including apps, HTML/CSS/JS) to make new stuff.

The students were experimenting with different ways to express their ideas: from mapping and infographics to visualisation, video, audio and photography. There was no lack of ideas from the students, from building interactive videos, using virtual reality all the way to creating highly interactive maps.

#Limits

However, there were a couple of things I noticed. Students did not have the technical grounding to move the more adventurous ideas forward and they found Immersive, the platform we used for publishing, somewhat limiting.

This wasn’t an exercise in developing technical skills but for exploring different ways of using media to tell stories. It seemed there were limits right from the start in that the general level of technical web literacy was low and this prevented many of the ideas from developing. This was not for want of trying from the students!

For example: copying and pasting embed codes wasn’t a problem and many students remembered me teaching them basic HTML tags such as ```<img>```, but working with simple frameworks such as visual Diff tools was hard and anything requiring Javascript - impossible.

When it came to assembling and publishing, some students were frustrated at the limitations of Immersive — a very easy to use long-form platform, but lacking in any kind of customisation.

#Coding and shorthand are enabling

Imagine sending a first year student out to cover a court story. They would find it incredibly difficult to write a report without first having a grounding in writing shorthand. They would be able to cobble something together from memory or the few bits of (possibly) inaccurate long-hand notes. Learning shorthand would enable them to write down court proceedings quickly and accurately, as they happened.

Imagine asking that same student to create a multimedia package. They might have some great ideas but would find it very difficult to create the media and piece it together in an interactive way using web technologies without first having a grounding in both audiovisual techniques and a good level of web literacy. They would be able to cobble something together that might not look too good and put the media into a template. Just as learning audiovisual techniques enables storytelling, having a grounding in web literacies (being able to write and manipulate HTML/CSS/JavaScript) enables them to move beyond the boundaries of being consumers/users of software or pre-designed, fixed templates to using the web to take control, realise ideas and experiment.

#How can we do this?

Becoming digitally and web literate doesn’t happen overnight and can’t be done in a few short workshops. Like learning shorthand it’s a long process combining theory and practice (lots of practice).

It’s such a fundamental part of journalism and media in general that in my view digital and web literacy should be treated the same as shorthand. It should be strongly embedded into the early stages of the journalism curriculum so it becomes an enabler later on.

Going back to the great ideas my students had: having strong web literacy would have enabled them to take control. They would have been able to make interactive HTML5 video and control map layers using Javascript, build better visualisations using scripts such as D3.js and present their media in a variety of different and exciting ways using any number of parallax scripts and frameworks.
