#A longform template

This template is in the style of a lonform page. The longform style strips out web page furniture such as header, nav, sidebar etc and puts the focus on content with full width images, large type and headers.

##Structure

The structure is really quite simple: Content is broken down into sections and headers using the HTML tags <section> and <header>.
